|Test case ID | UC13_TC1

|Description | Verify that the system can successfully execute batch calculations when all general information is provided

|Test Steps a|
1. User requests batch emission calculations providing the following information: 
  - Well-to-Wheel road transportation activity:
    * Gasoline Van using Gasoline/Ethanol 95/5 Blend and consuming `85,364l`
    * 7.5 t Diesel Truck using Diesel/Biodiesel Blend 95/5 and consuming `127,257l`
    * 40 t/Class 8 Truck using Diesel/Biodiesel Blend 95/5 and consuming `7,486l`
  - Road transport activity:
    * First Vehicle using a Diesel/Biodiesel Blend consumed `374,285l` of fuel
    * Second Vehicle using a Gasoline/Ethanol Blend consumed `85,364l` of fuel
2. User sends the request to the application
3. System accepts the request
4. System performs calculation
5. System responds with the following information:
  - Total of `944,635 kg of CO2-equivalent` emissions
    * Gasoline Van total of `239,019 kg of CO2-equivalent` emissions
    * 7.5 t Diesel Truck total of `403,404 kg of CO2-equivalent` emissions
    * 40 t/Class 8 Truck total of `23,730 kg of CO2-equivalent` emissions
    * Emissions by first vehicle type `235,800 kg of CO2-equivalent`
    * Emissions by second vehicle type `42,682 kg of CO2-equivalent`

|Expected Result | The `kg of CO2-equivalent` produced by the fuel consumption given by the User

  - Road transport activity:
    * First Vehicle using a Diesel/Biodiesel Blend consumed `374,285l` of fuel
    * Second Vehicle using a Gasoline/Ethanol Blend consumed `85,364l` of fuel
2. User sends the request to the application
3. System accepts the request
4. System tries to perform such calculation but provided data is not correct
5. System responds with a calculation not possible error

|Expected Result | System error informing of not possible to perform such calculation
