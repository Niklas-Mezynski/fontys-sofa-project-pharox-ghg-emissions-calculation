# 4. Assignment

The assignment for this project is to build a modular application within Google Firebase that helps Pharoxâ€™s clients to:

-	Calculate the GHG emissions of road-, rail-, air- and ocean transport in the supply chain upfront.
-	Monitor the GHG-emissions of the execution.
-	Provide management info where there is room to reduce the emissions.

The application should be integrated into the existing platforms like Smart Move, Smarti and Rail Easy or should feed our platforms. 

The modular solution should be based on the GLEC Framework industry standard.
