## 11. Risks
The above described project comes with certain risks. These are mentioned and evaluated in the following table 1. In order to define the risk level, the risk matrix in the Appendix A has been used.

|Risk|Description|Probability|Impact|Risk level|Countermeasures|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Veracity of the results|The results of GHG emissions calculations may be wrong if not applied carefully.|3|5|Very High|<ul><li>Perform several validation tests using different sets of data.</li><li>During validation, involve end users to validate the results obtained</li></ul> |
|Pharox environment permissions|During implementation phase, developing team will need access to some of the existing software developed by Pharox. For that access permissions may be required.|5|2|High|<ul><li>Discuss with Pharox, in advance, what existing software can be used for this project.</li><li>Ask for access permissions before starting of the implementation phase</li></ul>|
|Data availability|In order to perform the GHG emissions calculations, both customer and application data is needed. It may be that such data has not been uploaded to the databases and therefore is not available.|2|4|Moderate|<ul><li>Provide the system with default data to be able to perform estimations.</li><li>Inform the user that data is not available and therefore accurate calculations cannot be done.</li></ul>|
|Pharox stakeholders’ availability|Pharox stakeholders’ availability is needed on a weekly basis in order to make sure project adapts to their necessities and also to solve any questions or issue that might appear. It can happen that, due to other projects, Pharox stakeholders’ availability is limited.|1|1|Very low|<ul><li>Set up periodically sprint review meetings, where deliveries can be done, and feedback can be given.</li><li>Set up a weekly meeting, where all parties are available to talk about actual status and discuss any issues.</li></ul>|
|Calculation exceptions|As mentioned in the GLEC framework and in alignment with end user’s needs, it can be that special considerations have to be taken into a count while performing the GHG emissions calculations. It may be that such considerations are not possible to be applied at the moment of the calculation.|2|4|Medium|<ul><li>Perform an extensive requirements assessment before starting of implementation.</li><li>Build scalable solution where exceptions can be added to the GHG emissions calculations functions.</li></ul>|
