Pharoxâ€™ clients include big multinationals such as Walmart, Hema, and BASF. All these companies have the need to ship their goods. These shipments have a massive impact on GHG-Emissions like CO2. Transport contributes 14% to the emissions globally.  (CBS, 2023)

In The Netherlands this share is 11%. There is an increased focus on monitoring and reducing these emission contributions, not only because of pressure from society but also from regulatory bodies such as the European Union. There are many standards which can be used to monitor and measure the emitted gasses, such as the ISO 14064 and the GLEC-Framework.

Pharox has a wide suite of applications which help these companies plan and optimize their supply chains. They currently do not have an application which allows for this.
