# 9. Organization

In the following chapter the methodologies and tools used to make this assignment possible will be described as well as the work environment.

## 9.1 Methodologies

The team will use the Agile Scrum methodology will be used as a project management method. Scrum is a way of to get work done, as a team, in small pieces at a time. The team consists of the Product Owner Joris Tenhagen, the Scrum Master Patrick van Leipsig and the Developers. The Product Owner is responsible for ensuring the team is delivering the most valuable products while the Scrum Master helps the team to get organized effectively.

By using the Scrum methodology, the assignment will be broken into smaller pieces. Each of these pieces will be a functionality or user case, and they will be developed according to the 3 phases defined in chapter 5. This way, a functionality will be documented, developed, and tested, so the team will be then able to move into the next use case.

Sprints will be planned for a duration of 2 weeks. At the end of this period, the team will get together to hold the Sprint Review, where the Scrum Team and the key stakeholders review the work that has been done and give feedback. Followed by a Sprint Retrospective, where the Scrum Teams discuss how the last Sprint went and discuss ways to improve their effectiveness. Finally, the Sprint planning takes place to plan the upcoming Sprint.

Furthermore, there will be at least one weekly meeting with Pharox to discuss further questions that might arise while the development of the Sprint. This will be either Thursdays or Fridays at around 9:30, with preference for an online meeting via MS Teams. For informal communication or quick questions, the Slack channel provided by Pharox will be used. 

Atlassian Jira is used to manage the project and keep track of the progress. The backlog contains all the requirements and tasks that need to be done to complete the project. Also, it will be used to estimate the complexity of tasks, plan and track the different sprints, and assign tasks to the team members.

## 9.2 Work Environment

The work environment is built upon Googleâ€™s Firebase services. The backend with all calculations will be implemented in Firebase Cloud Functions. Pharox provides a separate Firebase project for the group to work with during the project. The source code and other artifacts will be stored in the FontysVenlo GitHub repository. After completion of the project the source code all related documents will be hand over to Pharox.
