# Requirements
The requirements of the project will be described in this document. There are 2 categories of requirements, these are functional and non-functional. 
The functional requirements are the ones that describe the functionality of the program, and the non-functional requirements are the ones that describe the technologies used performance requirements. 

## Functional requirements
This section of the document will introduce the functional requirements (FR) of the program. These will be separated into 3 categories (Must have, should have, and could have)
